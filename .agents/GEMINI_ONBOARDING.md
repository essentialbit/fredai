# Onboarding: Gemini as a Collaboration Board Peer

You're joining FredAI's development as a peer collaborator alongside Claude (working via Claude Code). FredAI's mission is to become the world's first Financial Super Intelligence — see `MISSION.md` at the repo root for the full L1-L6 roadmap and evaluation criteria.

Read these files first, in this order:
1. `MISSION.md` — the mission and FSI levels, so every suggestion is evaluated against it
2. `CLAUDE.md` — project conventions (deployment targets include Raspberry Pi Zero — avoid heavy ML dependencies)
3. `memory_store.py` — the `feature_backlog` schema and functions (`insert_feature_proposal`, `get_top_proposals`, `mark_proposal_in_progress`, `mark_proposal_done`, `get_track_record`)
4. `github_sync.py`, `risk_rules.py`, `debate.py` — the collaboration board substrate
5. `fred_rnd.py` / `gemini_rnd.py` — how proposals get discovered, inserted, and implemented (both agents already run an autonomous version of this every 6h via API key on the live instance)

## How the collaboration works

- Every proposal lives in `feature_backlog` AND is mirrored to a GitHub Issue labeled `agent-proposal`, `fsi-l{N}`, `category:{x}`, `risk:{low|medium|high}`, `proposed-by:{claude|gemini}`.
- Claude and Gemini review *each other's* open proposals (never their own) and post a stance as an issue comment: `agree`, `disagree`, or `escalate`, with a confidence score (0-1) and a short rationale. This produces a weighted consensus score (`debate.py::compute_consensus`) — `disagree` heavily discounts it, `escalate` forces it to zero.
- **`main` is branch-protected — nobody pushes directly, ever.** All code changes land as feature branches (`agent/{agent}-{proposal_id}-{date}` is the existing naming convention) opened as PRs. CI's `Validate` check must pass before anything merges. A human always makes the final merge decision.
- Risk classification (`risk_rules.py`) gates what's even eligible for future auto-merge: anything touching auth, payments, secrets, or the core data model is always `high` risk and always needs a human, regardless of consensus.

## What to do in an interactive session

1. Review open Issues labeled `agent-proposal` with `proposed-by:claude` that you haven't reviewed yet — post your stance in the format above.
2. Propose new ideas scoped against `MISSION.md`'s current active FSI level. For each: `insert_feature_proposal(..., proposed_by="gemini")`, then `github_sync.sync_proposal_to_issue(...)` — don't invent a parallel process.
3. If implementing something: branch off `main`, do the work, open a PR. Don't merge it yourself.
4. If you notice overlap with Claude's existing proposals, say so explicitly in the Issue thread rather than silently redoing the work. `insert_feature_proposal`'s dedup check (Jaccard word-overlap) isn't perfect — flag it yourself when you spot it.

Ask if anything about the existing schema/conventions is unclear before improvising a new pattern — the point of this board is one shared substrate, not two disconnected systems.
